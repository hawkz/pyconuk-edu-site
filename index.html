        <h1 id="intro">What is it?</h1>
        <p><a href="http://pyconuk.org/">PyconUK</a> is the UK's premier
        community organised conference about
        the <a href="http://python.org/">Python programming language</a>.</p>

        <p>On Friday 19th September teachers and developers will come together
        to collaborate on practical pythonic pedagogy. On Saturday 20th
        September we will welcome kids (young and old) for inspiring
        adventures in code.</p>

        <p>The PyconUK education track is all about the wonderful things that
        happen when diverse groups of people come together
        to work with fun technology. We'd like to thank our sponsors, without
        whom this event could not take place:
        <a href="http://corp.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>,
        <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">The Python Software Foundation</a>,
        <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">The Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>
        and our very own
        <a href="http://pyconuk.org/">PyconUK Society</a>.</p>

        <h1 id="teachers">For Teachers</h1>

        <p>Learn to use Python in your classroom!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Learn Python with experienced teachers and expert developers.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with programmers to create and share educational
            resources.</li>
            <li>Network with teaching colleagues and contacts in industry.</li>
            <li>Have fun exploring technology that will inspire your students.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The teacher's professional development day is on Friday 19th
        September in <a href="/location/index.html">Coventry</a>. The
        education team from the
        <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy/">RaspberryPi Foundation</a>,
        fellow teachers and an international group of Python experts will be
        on hand to help you get the most out of the day.</p>

        <h3>But what about the cost..?</h3>

        <p>We have you covered! (Literally)</p>

        <p>Thanks to the very generous sponsorship of
        <a href="http://corp.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> we will
        contribute &pound;200 to your school for the cost of a cover teacher.
        Furthermore, your ticket for the <em>whole four day conference</em>
        costs only &pound;47 (compared to &pound;150 for a regular full
        conference ticket).</p>

        <p>But space is limited! The contribution for a cover teacher is
        limited to the first twenty teachers who book a ticket.</p>

        <p><a href="#book">Book now</a> to avoid disappointment!</p>

        <h3>But I'm still not sure...</h3>

        <p>This video will give you a flavour of what to expect from PyconUK
        (<a href="http://about.me/BenLlewellynSmith">Ben Smith</a>, is
        a teacher who attended last year):</p>

        <h1 id="kids">For Kids</h1>

        <p>Do you like robots? Ever fancied programming Minecraft? Want to
        learn cool technical tricks from expert programmers? How about taking
        part in coding workshops?</p>

        <p>Yes?</p>

        <p>Great!</p>
        <p>You (or your kids) should come along to the PyconUK kid's
        day on Saturday 20th September in
        <a href="/location/index.html">Coventry</a> (9:30am - 3:30pm). Kid's
        tickets cost just &pound;5 each. All kids must be 18 years old or
        younger and attend with an adult who must remain on site at all times
        (accompanying adults get in for free). We'll even throw in a baked
        potato for lunch!</p>

        <p><a href="#book">Book now</a>, because places are limited!</p>

        <p>But what happens at a kid's day at PyconUK?</p>

        <p>Glad you asked! Mums and sons, dads and daughters and developers
        and teachers come
        together for exciting adventures in code. One example (among many)
        from last year was Rebecca, Penelope and Emily who worked with three
        professional developers to create a flying-saucer game in
        Minecraft. They ended up presenting their work to the <em>whole
        conference</em> and got a huge round of applause! Here they are
        explaining what they got up to:</p>

        <p>This year will be bigger, with more "stuff" to do and more things
        to see. There will be robots, workshops, coding, presentations and
        lots of fun surprises.</p>
